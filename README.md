# CS210_8-1

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program will create two clocks that display simutaneously and allow for user input using C++.

### What did you do particularly well?
I was able to get a fully functional program working. The code I wrote is very dynamic so any change is easy to make. There is minimal hard coded values in the code.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I need to add more comments and documentation to my code.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part to me is the C++ syntax as I do not have much experience with the language before this course.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The most important skills learned from this project is general programming knowledge. The syntax is important, but learning the basics and logic of coding will help you much more in the future.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I try to make my code modularized and readable even without comments. I believe that if your code needs much comments to be understood for a simple task, it is not very good code.
